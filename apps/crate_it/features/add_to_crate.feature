    And I have no files
    And I have folders "folder1/folder2"
    And I have file "file.txt" within the root folder
    And I have file "\&" within the root folder
    And I have file "file2.txt" within "folder1/folder2"
    And I'm logged in to ownCloud as "test"
    And I go to the files page

    Then I go to the crate_it page
