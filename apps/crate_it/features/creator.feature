    #CRATEIT-224
    Scenario: A creator edited from the mint does not display URL
      Given I click to wrap Creators
      Given I fill in "keyword_creator" with "John"
      And I click the search creator button
      And I add creator "1" to the list
      When I edit creator "john@smith.com"
      And I fill in "edit-creators-email" with "john@smith.org"
      Then the "Save" button in the popup dialog should not be disabled
