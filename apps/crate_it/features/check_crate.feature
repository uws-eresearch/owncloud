Feature:Check crate
  As a user
  I want to check if the files/folders in the crate are consistent

  Background:

    And I have no files
    And I have folders "folder1/folder2"
    And I have file "file0.txt" within the root folder
    And I have file "file1.txt" within the root folder
    And I have file "file2.txt" within "folder1/folder2"
    And I have crate "crate1"
    And I'm logged in to ownCloud as "test"
    And I go to the crate_it page
    And I select crate "crate1"
    And I go to the files page
